## About
It provides information about intended use and risk which may be useful to those using or assessing the system.
The structure of this card is loosely aligned with the requirements of the [EU AI Act Annex IV](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/annex/4/) and [Article 11](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/11/).

## Intended Use
**Purpose / Value Proposition:**  
AutoDCA (Automated Decline Curve Analysis) provides automation tools for efficient, high-quality decline curve analysis.

**Note:** DCA assumes wells exhibit steady production decline, typical of mature wells past peak production.
Deviations may impact prediction accuracy.
Use judgment and review debugging figures to assess performance.

**Primary Users:**  
  - Reservoir Engineers
  - Production Engineers
  - Other professionals involved in well performance analysis and forecasting

**Limitations:**  
  - Not suitable for wells in early production phase (unless it is declining)
  - Requires sufficient historical data

## Human Oversight
- AutoDCA is **decision support** for production forecasting; engineers review automated curve fits and forecasts before making business decisions.
- **Required validation**: Subject Matter Expert (SME) review of decline curve parameters, forecast assumptions, and quality control plots.
- **Limitations**: Requires domain expertise to validate appropriateness of DCA for specific wells.
- **Anticipated issues**: Over-reliance on automated forecasts without proper quality control.
